		<p>🟠 HOW TO CREATE MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS:<br><br><br>


			ONE GMAIL = 20+ ACCOUNTS<br><br>

			In a SINGLE gmail account, you can create more than 20 accounts when you make SNS accounts. To create all of these accounts, you must first have a gmail account where you’ll need to verify the registration in MAMA 2021.<br><br>

			When making SNS accounts, make sure you have opened the gmail account you’ll use. Proceed making a SNS account when using a gmail account. You can create multiple accounts with one gmail account. For example when making a Facebook account:<br><br>

			The gmail that you will use is envtmama001@gmail.com<br><br>

			You can use these gmail again and again but in different formats like its original format envtmama001@gmail.com, then when creating another facebook account, you can use envtmama001@googlemail.com, envtmama001+1@gmail.com, envtmama001+2@gmail.com, and so on.<br><br> 

			You can use this method when creating facebook, twitter, kakaotalk, and twitch. You will receive verification emails in the same gmail which is the envtmama001@gmailcom. All mails that are sent using a different domain or format of the gmail will automatically direct on that single gmail account. </p>
			<p>CAN WE MERGE THESE ACCOUNTS INTO A VERIFIED MAMA ACCOUNT?<br><br>

			YES, you can merge all of your created SNS accounts into a single gmail. When registering on MAMA,just  make sure that you will click ‘MERGE ID’ so you won’t be filling up again and that makes the registration easier. Each SNS account will be automatically merged and can be used to vote multiple times. Each account in MAMA can be merged into more than 5 accounts when you have made multiple accounts in every SNS account that is allowed to use in MAMA. 
			</p>
			<p>ALL ABOUT KAKAOTALK<br><br>

			When creating kakaotalk accounts, you can use different domains that are stated above that direct to one gmail only. For registering accounts on MAMA, you can use the domain googlemail.com to create another account in MAMA aside from the gmail.com domain on kakao. This can multiply your accounts aside from the gmail.com domain that is being used. 
			</p>
			<p>🟠 HOW TO VOTE USING MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS:<br><br>

				🔸 USE INCOGNITO TAB.<br><br>
				&emsp;- If you’re using mobile, open your chrome browser, click the three dot icon in the top-right corner. Then tap the “new incognito tab”.<br>
				&emsp;- If you’re using a laptop/pc the easiest way of opening an incognito tab is to press ‘CTRL + SHIFT + N”<br>
				&emsp;▶️ Cast your votes using the incognito tab. Login your accounts there and drop your votes right away. If you want to log-in again with another set of accounts, exit the tab & open incognito tab again. Your previous accounts will be automatically logged out and the chrome browser won’t save the datas and information when the incognito tab is enabled. With this trick you can now be able to cast your votes again from another set of accounts.<br>
			</p>
			<p>🔸 WEB BROWSERS:<br>
			&emsp;- Google Chrome <br>
			&emsp;- Microsoft Edge<br>
			&emsp;- Opera <br>
			&emsp;- Firefox<br><br>
			▶️ You can use these browsers aside from Chrome at the same time to maximize your time. This is only optional since you can also use an incognito window when casting votes.<br><br>
			🔸 USE SPLIT SCREEN <br><br>

			- If you’re using a Laptop/PC, long press the Windows Key button and tap the right or left arrow key. This will automatically assign a side of the screen and split the window over there. <br><br><br>
			▶️ Open the Mwave website on both of your screens and you can now cast your votes using different accounts on both screens. Some android devices also have this type of feature so you can try it too! This is also effective when we are having our mass voting & suddenly ENHYPEN goes live or when they drop a sudden content. <br><br><br>
